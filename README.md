# SmartFarm
The system will notify the user whenever the plant needs water.
# Abstract
Agriculture plays an important role in the overall economic development of a nation. Advancements in technological arena will increase the competence of some farming activities. In this project, we have proposed a methodology for smart farming by using a smart sensing system which makes use of a wireless communication technology. This system focuses on the measurement of physical factors such as soil moisture content, nutrient content and pH of the soil. We will also use water level sensor and based on that sensor output, we will drive our motor to supply water to plant. After the development of the basic model, an android app will be created which will notify the user to water the plant. This project uses both hardware and software technology to achieve its goal.
