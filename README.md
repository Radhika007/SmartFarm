# fernweh
(n) an ache for distant places; the craving for travel.

While someone with wanderlust might sit at home and happily fantasise about all the places they might visit, 
someone with fernweh would feel a deeper sense of longing, a sort of homesickness but for foreign lands.

# use
Sit at home and take a look at the places you might want to travel whenever you feel the urge to do so. 

# you only live once
